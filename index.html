        <h2><strong>About Me:</strong></h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Zimri, an aspiring Software Engineer with a current background in Software Quality Assurance. <br>
        I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Clemson University with a minor in AI. My journey at Eleos Technologies, where I progressed to a Tier II Software QA Analyst role, 
        has helped me strengthen my ability in QA finding defects across multiple platforms and bridging between QA and Engineering.
        This experience has taught me how to view code through the lens of the user, and ensuring that what I build isn't just functionable but also resilient.<br>
